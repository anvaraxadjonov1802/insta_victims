## Overview

This was one of my first contacts with web layout that I did a few years ago. A Responsive Instagram Login Clone built using only [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html) and [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/) for educational purposes.

### Demonstration

## What have I learned?

* CSS:
  * BEM methodology.
  * How to strategically use the ```margin```, ```padding``` and ```position: relative``` rules.
  * How to work with relative units like EM and REM.
  * Variables.
  * Flexbox.
  * Treat the layout as a set of components.
  * Basics of Responsive Web Design.
  * To minimize code seeing patterns and common properties (minus components because they have to be independent of everything) by creating "helper classes" (as if we were dealing with a framework). Examples given on typography or on some positioning such as ```text-align: center```.
